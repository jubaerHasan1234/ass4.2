# Assignment four is complete.

### Features I implemented to make the UI better.

1. Added a spinner animation when fetching 'model data' in advanced settings.
2. There are advanced settings and input boxes for 'seed, width, height'. Clicking Enter will generate the image.
3. If the user mistakenly enters without typing the prompt, a 'pop-up' will appear.
4. Moreover, various 'pop-ups' have been added due to various user actions.
5. Added 'loading animation' for creating an image and 'spinner' inside it.
6. I don't like having a 'download button' on the download page, so it has been removed, but if you want it, you can download it on the download page by removing the 'route === "download" ' and the condition.
